# Arduino volume control knob module

This project introduces an Arduino-based module designed as a standalone hardware interface for volume control on a PC. Users can connect the module to their PC via USB and independently program the accompanying PC-side application to interact with the module. The module empowers users with the flexibility to tailor the PC-side application according to their specific requirements while providing versatile volume control functionalities.

## Purpose

The primary objective of this project is to offer seamless volume control capabilities for a PC environment. The standalone nature of the Arduino module allows users to develop customized PC-side applications, ensuring compatibility and integration with diverse software environments. By providing a dedicated hardware interface, the module enhances user experience and facilitates intuitive volume adjustments.


## Features

- **Global Volume Control:** The module features a primary rotary knob for adjusting the volume of the entire PC system.
- **Application-specific Volume Control:** Adjacent to the primary knob, a secondary knob or slider, accompanied by a TFT display, allows users to adjust the volume of individual applications or groups of applications.
- **TFT Display:** The TFT display provides visual feedback, showing icons representing the currently adjusted application or group of applications.
- **Non-linear Volume Adjustment:** Utilizing non-linear volume adjustment mechanisms, the module ensures precise and intuitive control, akin to the incremental scrolling of a computer mouse wheel.
- **Basic Settings Configuration:** Users can configure various parameters, such as volume adjustment increments and application-specific volume control, to suit their unique requirements.

## Implementation Details

- **Communication Interface**: The Arduino module communicates with the PC via a serial link.
- **TFT Display**: The module incorporates a TFT display to provide visual feedback, showing icons representing the currently adjusted application or group of applications.
- **Icon Display**: Icons representing installed applications are stored on an SD card, accessible by the module for display purposes. New icons can also be transferred via the serial link.
- **Volume Control Mechanism**: The module utilizes rotary knobs or sliders for volume adjustment, offering both global volume control for the entire PC system and application-specific volume control.
- **Non-linear Volume Adjustment**: The volume adjustment mechanism ensures precise and intuitive control, simulating the incremental scrolling of a computer mouse wheel.
- **Additional Controls**: Supplementary controls, such as buttons, may be included for additional functionalities, such as synchronization of audio across all applications.
- **Customization**: Users can customize the module settings, possibly through an on-screen menu accessible via buttons, to tailor the volume control experience to their preferences.

## Compatibility

This module is designed to work with any PC, regardless of the operating system or programming language used in the external application.
